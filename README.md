This program is pretty straight forward,
all you need to remember is to open Visual Studio with Admin Priv's 
or else it WILL NOT WORK. The file is saved to your C Drive So all you have to do
is go to your c drive and you will find a file named MyCharacter.txt in there you will find the information you need.
If you want to change the place where the file ends up you can go into the code and change the path on line 11
